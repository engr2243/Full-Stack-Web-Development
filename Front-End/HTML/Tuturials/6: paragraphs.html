        <!-- HTML Display
            - You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed.
            - Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results.
            - With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.
            - The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed: -->

            <p>
                This paragraph
                contains a lot of lines
                in the source code,
                but the browser
                ignores it.
            </p>
                
            <p>
                This paragraph
                contains         a lot of spaces
                in the source         code,
                but the        browser
                ignores it.

        <!-- HTML Horizontal Rules:
        - The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.
        - The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page:
        -->
        <h1>This is heading 1</h1>
        <p>This is some text.</p>
        <hr title="Showing thematic break">
        <h2>This is heading 2</h2>
        <p>This is some other text.</p>
        <hr title="Showing thematic break">

        <!-- HTML Line Breaks:
        - The HTML <br> element defines a line break.
        - Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph: 
        -->
        <p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p>
